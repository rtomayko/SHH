## Forward

In the hands of competent, the UNIX shell language and utilities are a powerful
programming environment.

You'll find no better, more practical alternative for the problems shell solves
well. Riddled with landmines, incompatible implementations, and an innate urge
on the part of programmers to exceed shell's natural limits.

But, well, you go to war with the tools you have, not the tools you might want
or wish to have at a later time. And once you pick up a few tricks of the trade
for reigning in the bad parts, you'll find that shell is not only an extremely
capable language but also that it's elegant.

This is the Shell Hater's Handbook. Part style guide, part field manual, it
contains the result of many hard-learned lessons over decades of real world
shell hacking. It's goal is provide a set of guidelines for achieving simple,
predictable, reliable, and fast programs.
